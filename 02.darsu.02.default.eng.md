## Notes
### No articles

Globasa has neither definite nor indefinite articles (the words _a_ and _the_ in English). In a subsequent lesson, you will learn how to emphasize definiteness when necessary. 

* **bwaw** - _dog(s)_, _a dog_ or _the dog(s)_

### No conjugation

Globasa has no verb conjugation, meaning that verbs don’t change according to the subject (or _doer_) of the sentence. For example, in English, the verb _work_ can be conjugated as 'I _work_ hard' and 'she _works_ hard.' In Globasa, on the other hand, we only use **ergo**.

* **ergo** - _work_ or _works_

### Dictionary Verb Form

The dictionary form of the verb is equivalent to the English _simple present_ or the _present progressive_.

* **fley** - _fly_, _flies_, _am flying_, _is flying_ or _are flying_

## Example Sentences

**Mahi suyon.**   
The fish swim(s). _or_ The fish is/are swimming.  

**Mi doxo.**  
I read. _or_ I am reading.
