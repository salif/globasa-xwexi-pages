## Notes
### Recipient Marker _tas_

The _recipient_ (commonly known as the _indirect object_) is marked with the preposition **tas** (_to, for_). It is always obligatory, meaning that it should never be omitted. The recipient may come right after the direct object or between the verb and the direct object.

**Am gibe tas mi kamisa.**  
Give me the shirt.

**Am gibe kursi tas mi.**  
Give the chair to me.

### _ki_

The word **ki** is a conjunction meaning _that_, not to be confused with the determiner **den** (_that_, as opposed to _this_). It always introduces a clause (a sentence within a sentence). 

**Mi fikir ki yusu netoposta sen daymo lungo.**  
I think (that) your email is very long.

In the sentence above, _your email is very long_ is a clause, or a complete sentence within the larger sentence. Notice that in English the word _that_ is optional. In Globasa, on the other hand, **ki** is obligatory, never optional.  

### Compound Words with _kal_

The word **kal** (_empty_) is the opposite of **pul**. Like **pul**, it may be used as a suffix meaning _without sufficient_ and is often translated as _-less_ in English.

poor (money-less): <textarea width="100%" spellcheck="false" placeholder="Type your answer here."></textarea>

### Phrases Denoting Time

The word **fe** is also used with expressions of time but is usually optional in these cases, such as in (**fe**) **ban mara** or (**fe**) **duli mara**. In the phrase **duli mara**, the word **duli** is a derived word using the prefix **du-**. In Lesson 19, you will learn another way to use **duli**.
