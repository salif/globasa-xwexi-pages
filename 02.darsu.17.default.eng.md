## Notes
### _hay_

The word **hay** expresses _there is/are_, but is also used in reference to the environment where English uses _it's_.
 
**To barix.** or **Hay barix.**  
It's raining. (There's rain.)

**To taluji.** or **Hay taluji.**  
It's snowing. (There's snow.)

**To sen termopul.** or **Hay termo.**  
It's warm. (There's heat/warmth.)

**To sen bardipul.** or **Hay bardi.**  
It's cold. (There's cold.)

### Compound Words with Adjectives as Quasi-prefixes

Many adjectives may be used as quasi-prefixes to form compounds. Words with adjective quasi-prefixes take on a more specific meaning than a noun modified with the given adjective would have. 

For example, the adjective **day** (_big, large_) can be used as an augmentative quasi-prefix and is used for deriving words that denote an increase in size, age, degree, quantity or loudness as compared with the root. 

_Fill in the blanks below:_
 
* awesome, great, excellent:
* huge:
* tiny:
* yell:
* grandmother:

Likewise, the word **lil** (_little, small_) can be used to derive words that denote a reduction in size, degree, quantity or loudness as compared with the root.

_Fill in the blanks below:_

* whisper:
* nap:
* drizzle:
* grandchild:

### Adverbs of Degree

The word **daymo** is an adverb of degree meaning _greatly_ or _very_. 

* **daymo hazuni** - very sad

The word **lilmo**, the opposite of **daymo**, is an adverb of degree meaning _a little_ and is used to modify adjectives or other adverbs.
 
* **lilmo hazuni** - a little sad

In previous lessons we have seen other words that add **-mo**. As we can see, adj/adv words (**max**, **min**, **kufi**, **day**, **lil**) that modify other adj/adv words must add **-mo**: **maxmo**, **minmo**, **kufimo**, **daymo**, **lilmo**.  

## Example Sentences
