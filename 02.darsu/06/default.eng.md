## Notes

### Noun Phrases 

Noun phrases must always end in a noun or pronoun. This is the reason why **hin** and **den** can never stand alone. Likewise, when **multi** and **xosu** are used in noun phrases they must always be followed by either a noun or a pronoun. Although **te** and **to** are singular pronouns they may be used with words denoting plurality, such as **multi** and **xosu**. 

**Yu hare multi bete mas mi hare xosu _te_.**  
You have many children but I have few (of them). 

**Yu le yam xosu jubin ji mi le yam multi _to_.**  
You ate a little (bit of) cheese and I ate a lot (of it). 

### Adverbs

Adverbs have the same form as adjectives. They typically precede the verbs they modify but may optionally follow the verb.

**Uma velosi pawbu.** or **Uma pawbu velosi.**  
The horse runs fast.

If the sentence has a direct object, the adverb may optionally follow it.

**Matre multi lubi bete.** or **Matre lubi bete multi.**  
The mother loves the child a lot.

Be careful not to place the adverb between the verb and the direct object. A modifying word in that spot would function as an adjective modifying the direct object.

**Matre lubi multi bete.**  
The mother loves many children.

### Past and Future Tenses

The particle **le** marks the past tense and the particle **xa** marks the future tense. Verb particles are used at the _beginning_ of a verb phrase, preceding any adverbs, as well as **no**. The word order for _verb phrases_ is as follows: _verb particle -- negation -- adverb -- verb_. 

**Femixu le hox ore musika.**    
The woman happily listened to the music. 

**Manixu le no hox ore musika.**    
The man didn't happily listen to the music.

**Myaw xa velosi glu sui.**    
The cat will quickly drink the water.

**Bwaw xa no velosi glu sui.**    
The dog will not drink the water quickly.

### Prepositional Phrases

Globasa uses prepositions to form prepositional phrases.

* **in banyokamer** - in the bathroom

Prepositional phrases link to the subject using the verb **sen**, seen in Lesson 5.  

**Myaw sen in banyokamer.**  
The cat is in the bathroom.

Prepositional phrases also modify noun phrases and verb phrases. 

Prepositional phrases immediately follow the noun phrases they modify.

**Myaw in banyokamer somno.**  
The cat in the bathroom is sleeping.

Prepositional phrases that modify verbs enjoy relative free word order and may be moved anywhere in the sentence. When moved before the verb, commas are used as seen below.

**Myaw yam in kokikamer piu.  
Myaw yam piu in kokikamer.  
Myaw, in kokikamer, yam piu.  
In kokikamer, myaw yam piu.**  
The cat eats the bird in the kitchen.
