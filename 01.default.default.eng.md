Globasa is the product of an elaborate thought experiment. It envisions the linguistic outcome of a hypothetical scenario whereby 1,000 people from around the world are randomly selected to permanently inhabit an island. What would the community's language look like within three generations? This is Globasa's _guiding vision_.

Globasa's design is primarily the work of a linguist, translator and expert in adult language acquisition and teaching. It has been created with the average world citizen in mind to be as easy as possible to learn and to use without sacrificing clarity and degree of expressiveness. Its design, reminiscent of the world's creole languages, is the result of the following guiding principles:

* Optimal simplicity with the goal of maximum learnability and ease of use for both speaker and listener
* Optimal balance between opposing linguistic parameters
* Internationality
