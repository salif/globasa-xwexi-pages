## Gender

In Globasa, only a handful of words, such as matre and patre, indicate gender. Otherwise, words denoting people are gender-neutral. In a subsequent lesson, you will learn how to distinguish between males and females using gender adjectives as prefixes. 
 
## No Plural Nouns

Globasa does not distinguish between singular and plural nouns. In a subsequent lesson, you will learn how to indicate plurality when necessary. 

* doste - friend or friends

## Lesson Activity
