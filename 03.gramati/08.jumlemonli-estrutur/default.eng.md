## Strict Word Order

In Globasa, a relatively strict word order is applied within phrases.

## Noun Phrases <a id="namelexili_jumlemon"></a>

Noun phrases consist of the following structure, as illustrated in the table below:

(Specifier) + (Complement) + Head

<table style="width:100%">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="6"><b>Noun Phrase</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="3">(Specifier)</th>
				<th colspan="2">(Complement)</th>
				<th>Head</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Determiner</b></td>
				<td><b>Possessive Adj</b></td>
				<td><b>Quantifier</b></td>
				<td><b>Adj/Adv-Modying<br>
				Adverb</b></td>
				<td><b>Adjective(s)</b></td>
				<td><b>Noun or Pronoun</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>ke</b> - which<br>
				<b>hin</b> - this<br>
				<b>den</b> - that<br>
				<b>ban</b> - some<br>

				<td><b>misu</b> - my<br>
				<b>yusu</b> - your<br>
				<b>tesu</b> - her/his<br>
				etc.</td>
				<td><b>multi</b> - many<br>
				<b>xosu</b> - few,<br>
				<b>total</b> - whole,<br>
				<b>plu</b> - multiple<br>
				(any number)<br>
				etc.</td>
				<td><b>daymo</b> - very<br>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="6" style="font-size:125%;"><b>hin misu care daymo lama kitabu</b><br>

			</tr>
		</tbody>
</table>

Since specifiers and complements are optional, a noun phrase may consist of a single noun, for example, **kitabu**.

### Third-Person Pronouns at End of Noun Phrases <a id="pronamelexi_in_namelexili_jumlemon"></a>

Noun phrases must always end in either a noun or a pronoun. Whenever a noun is understood and omitted, a pronoun must replace it, rather than leaving a specifier or complement hanging. Without the use of pronouns to complete noun phrases, such phrases would have different meanings or create incomplete and therefore ungrammatical sentences.

### Determiner + Pronoun = Complete Noun Phrase

**_Banete_ ergo velosi ji _banete_ ergo hanman.**  
_Some_ work quickly and _some_ work slowly. 

Without the pronoun **te**, the sentence would read:  
**Ban ergo sen velosi ji ban ergo sen hanman.**  
Some work is fast and some work is slow.

### Possessive Adj + Pronoun (Possessive Pronoun) = Complete Noun Phrase

**Yusu gami ergo velosi mas _misu_ te ergo hanman.**  
Your spouse works fast but _mine_ works slow.

Without the pronoun **te**, the second part of the sentence would read:  
**Misu ergo sen hanman.**  
My work/job is slow.

### Quantifier + Pronoun = Complete Noun Phrase

**Dua basataytiyen ergo velosi mas _un te_ ergo hanman.**  
Two translators work quickly but _one_ works slowly.

Without the pronoun **te**, the second part of the sentence would read:  
**Un ergo sen hanman.**  
One job is slow.

### Adjective + Pronoun = Complete Noun Phrase

**Day manyen ergo velosi mas _lil te_ ergo hanman.**  
The big man works quickly but the _small one_ works slowly.

Without the pronoun **te**, the second part of the sentence would read:  
**Lil ergo sen hanman.**  
The small job is slow.

## Verb Phrases

Verb phrases are similar in structure to noun phrases:

			<td colspan="7"><b>Verb Phrase</b></td>

</table>

### Verb Markers

As specifiers, verb markers (**nun**, **le**, **xa**, **ger**, **am**, **na**) are placed at the start of verb phrases.

### Adverbs

As seen in the sentence above, adverbs (or adverb phrases) typically precede verbs.

Alternatively, adverbs may be placed after the verb, immediately following objects, if any.

* If the sentence has no direct or indirect objects the adverb may immediately follow the verb.

**Femyen danse _meli_.**  
The lady dance _beautifully_.

* However, if the sentence contains objects, the adverb phrase must immediately follow all objects.

**Mi le gibe pesa tas coriyen _volekal_ koski mi le befobi ki te xa morgi mi.**  
I gave the money to the thief _involuntarily_ because I feared he would kill me.

Adverbs may also be moved to the start of the sentence, so long as there is a definite pause with the comma to separate the phrase from the rest of the sentence. Without the pause, the adjective/adverb could be mistakenly interpreted as modifying the subject.

**_Velosi_, bwaw glu sui.**  
_Quickly_, the dog drinks the water.

**_Unyum_, te le idi cel banko.**  
_First_, she went to the bank.

## Negation

The negating adverb **no** immediately precedes the word or phrase being negated.

**Manyen _no godomo bur_ danse.**  
or: **Manyen danse _no godomo bur_.**  
The man _doesn't_ dance _too badly_.

In the second sentence above, **no** is along with the rest of the complement to the end of the sentence. (The man did dance, but not too badly.)

Alternatively, **no** could immediately precede the verb and interpreted as modifying the verb plus its descriptive adverbs.

**Manixu _no danse godomo bur_.**  
The man _doesn't dance too badly_.

## Infinitive Verb Phrases

Infinitive verb phrases have the following structure:

**na** + verb phrase

See [Infinitive Verb Phrases](/gramati/jumleli-estrutur#nafalelexili_jumlemon) under Sentence Structure.

## Prepositional Phrases

Globasa, like most SVO languages, uses prepositions rather than [postpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition). Prepositional phrases are composed of a preposition followed by a noun phrase.

<table style="width:100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="2"><b>Prepositional Phrase</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Preposition</th>
<th>Noun Phrase</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>in </b><br>in</td>
<td><b>day sanduku</b><br>large box</td>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" style="font-size:125%;"><b>in day sanduku</b><br>in the large box</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

The position of prepositional phrases within sentences is explained under [Sentence Structure](/gramati/jumleli-estrutur#plasilexili_jumlemon).

## Adverbs of Focus

Other than **no** (_not_), _Adverbs of focus_, such as **sol** (_only_), **pia** (_also_, _too_) and **hata** (_even_), do not appear in the Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase tables above. The reason for this is that _adverbs of focus_ can appear anywhere in a sentence, depending on what is being modified in the sentence. _Adverbs of focus_ always immediately precede the phrase or word they modify.

**Misu gami glu _sol_ kafe fe soba.**  
My spouse drinks _only_ coffee in the morning.

**Misu gami glu kafe _hata_ fe axam.**  
My spouse drinks coffee _even_ in the evening.

**_Pia_ misu gami glu kafe fe soba.**  
My spouse, _too_, drinks coffee in the morning.

## Complex Adjective Phrases

Complex adjective phrases come after the nouns they modify.

**Adj/Adv plus Prepositional Phrase**

**kitabu eskrido fal misu doste**  
the book written by my friend

**alimyen hox kos yusu sukses**  
the teacher happy for your success

**Comparative Adj/Adv Phrases**

**nini maxmo lao kom misu sodar**  
the kid older than my brother

## Relative Clauses <a id="relativo_baxjumle"></a>

In Globasa, relative clauses are introduced with the _modifying clause marker_ **hu** and retain typical word order. It is worth noting that the conjunction **hu** doesn't have an exact equivalent in English but is typically translated as _who_,  _which_, or _that_. 

### Relative Clauses with Resumptive Pronoun

Relative clauses that require a pronoun to refer back to the antecedent use the _obligatory_ resumptive relative pronoun **da** (_he, she, it, they, that, that one, those, those ones_). 
 
**Te sen femixu _hu da lubi mi_.**   
"She is the woman _who that-one loves me_."    
She is the woman _who loves me_.  

**Te sen femixu _hu mi lubi da_.**   
"She is the woman _who I love that-one_."    
She is the woman _whom I love_.

**Mi le sonxi katatul _hu mi kata roti yon da_.**    
"I lost the knife _which I cut the bread with that-one_."  
I lost the knife _with which I cut the bread_.

**Kamisa _hu mi suki da_ sen blue.** or **To sen blue, kamisa _hu mi suki da_.**     
"The shirt _which I like that-one_ is blue." or "It's blue, the shirt _which I like that-one_."   
The shirt _(that) I like_ is blue. _or_ It's blue, the shirt _(that) I like_. 

_Note: As seen in the last example, when the relative clause is part of the subject, the sentence may be reworded in order to place the core of the sentence first and move the relative clause to the end of the sentence. This helps to make the sentence easier to process._

The possessive adjective **dasu** is used in relative clauses as follows:

**Te sen manixu _hu dasu sodar kone mi_.**     
"He is the man _who his brother knows me._"      
He is the man _whose brother knows me_.

**Te sen manixu _hu mi kone dasu sodar_.**      
"He is the man _who I know his brother_."  
He is the man _whose brother I know_.

**Manyen _hu dasu gami Globasa_ sen misu doste.** _or_ **Te sen misu doste, manyen _hu dasu gami Globasa_.**  
"The guy _who that-one's spouse speaks Globasa_ is my friend." _or_ "He's my friend, the guy _who that one's spouse speaks Globasa_."   
The guy _whose spouse speaks Globasa_ is my friend. _or_ He is my friend, the guy _whose spouse speaks Globasa_.

### Relative Clauses with Resumptive Correlative Adverb

Relative clauses in which a correlative adverb refers back to the antecedent are as follows:  

**Kitabudom _hu mi ergo denloka_ sen day.**    
"The library _which I work there_ is big."   
_or_  
**Kitabudom _hu denloka mi ergo_ sen day.**  
"The library _which there I work_ is big."  
The library _where I work_ is big.  

**Din _hu mi xa preata denwatu_ sen Lunadin.**      
"The day _which I arrive then_ is Monday."  
_or_  
**Din _hu denwatu mi xa preata_ sen Lunadin.**  
"The day _which then I arrive_ is Monday."  
The day _when I arrive_ is Monday.

Instead of correlative adverbs, prepositional phrases may be used to convey equivalent sentences. 

**Kitabudom _hu mi ergo in da_ sen day.**   
"The library _which I work in it_ is big."  
_or_  
**Kitabudom _hu in da mi ergo_ sen day.**    
"The library _which in it I work_ is big."  
The library _in which I work_ is big.  

**Din _hu mi xa preata fe da_ sen Lunadin.**   
"The day _which I arrive on it_ is Monday."  
_or_  
**Din _hu fe da mi xa preata_ sen Lunadin.**  
"The day _which on it I arrive_ is Monday."  
The day _on which I arrive_ is Monday.  

### Relative Clauses in Non-Specific Noun Phrases

Non-specific noun phrases with relative clauses may be composed of **to/te** plus a resumptive correlative adverb or **da**. 

**Mi no suki _to hu mi ergo denloka_.**  
"I don't like _it which I work there_."   
_or_  
**Mi no suki _to hu denloka mi ergo_.**   
"I don't like _it which there I work_."  
I don't like _where I work_.  

**Mi suki _to hu yu broxa misu tofa denmaner_.**  
"I like _it which you brush my hair that way_."  
_or_  
**Mi suki _to hu denmaner yu broxa misu tofa_.**  
"I like _it which that way you brush my hair_."  
I like _how you brush my hair_.  

**Am gibe tas mi _to hu mi vole da_.**    
"Give me _it which I want that_."  
Give me _what I want_.  

**Mi no suki _te hu yu le seleti da_.**  
"I don't like _her/him/them who you chose that-one._"  
I don't like _whom you chose_.  

Alternatively, they may be composed of a noun plus a resumptive prepositional phrase or **da**. 

**Mi no suki _loka hu mi ergo in da_.**    
"I don't like _the place which I work in that_."   
_or_    
**Mi no suki _loka hu in da mi ergo_.**     
"I don't like _the place which in that I work_."  
I don't like _the place in which I work_.  

**Mi suki _maner hu yu broxa misu tofa yon da_.**   
"I like _the way which you brush my hair in that_."    
_or_    
**Mi suki _maner hu yon da yu broxa misu tofa_.**  
"I like _the way which in that you brush my hair_."  
I like _the way in which you brush my hair_.  

**Am gibe tas mi _xey hu mi vole da_.**  
"Give me _the thing which I want that_."  
Give me _the thing (that) I want_.    

**Mi no suki _person hu yu le seleti da_.**  
"I don't like _the person who you chose that-one._"    
I don't like _the person you chose_.

## Non-relative Modifying Clauses

Nouns are sometimes modified with clauses that are not relative, in other words, clauses without a resumptive element. These clauses are introduced using **feki**.

**Singa begude idey _feki maux ger abil na sahay te_.**  
The lion was tickled by the idea _that the mouse could help him_.

## Clauses with _feki_ instead of Relative Clauses with _hu_

Noun phrases with words of place, time, manner and reason may be modified using clauses with **feki** instead of relative clauses with **hu**. In other words, in order to create shorter sentences without resumptive clauses, **feki** may replace **hu** plus a resumptive correlative or prepositional phrase (**hu denloka/hu in da**, **hu denwatu/hu fe da**, **hu denmaner/hu yon da**, **hu denseba/hu kos da**). 

**Mi no suki _restoran feki imi le yam_.**   
"I don't like _the restaurant that we ate at_."    
I don't like _the restaurant we ate at_.  

**Te sokutu _(fe) moy mara feki te estaycu_.**  
"He falls every time that he stands up."  
He falls every time he stands up.   

**Mi suki _maner feki yu broxa misu tofa_.**   
"I like _the way that you brush my hair_."       
I like _the way you brush my hair_.    

**_Seba feki yu no xwexi_ sen koski yu no abyasa.**  
"The reason that you don't learn is because you don't practice."  
The reason you don't learn is because you don't practice.
