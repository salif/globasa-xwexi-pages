## SVO

The typical phrase order in Globasa is _Subject-Verb-Object_.

<table style="width:100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3"><b>SVO Sentence Structure</b></td>

<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Verb</th>
<th>Object</th>

<tr>
<td><b>patre</b><br>father</td>
<td><b>mwa</b><br>kiss</td>
<td><b>matre</b><br>mother</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" style="font-size:125%;"><b>Patre mwa matre.</b><br>The father kisses the mother. </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

## Direct Object Marker

Other than S-V-O, Globasa allows two other options with the subject always preceding the verb: S-O-V and O-S-V.  This flexible phrase order is made possible using the direct object marker **el**, which essentially functions as a preposition. As illustrated below, **el** is used with S-O-V and O-S-V, which are typically only used in poetry and song lyrics.

* **Patre mwa matre.** - (S-V-O) The father kisses the mother.
* **Patre el matre mwa.** - (S-O-V) The father kisses the mother.
* **El matre patre mwa.** - (O-S-V) The father kisses the mother.  

_Etymology of **el**: Korean (을 “eul”)_

## Copula

The verb **sen** (_be_), known as the _copula_, functions as a predicate marker with phrases other than predicate verb phrases, linking the subject with noun phrases, nominal (infinitive) verb phrases, adjective phrases, prepositional phrases and clauses.

</tr>
</tbody></table>

The question words **keloka** and **kewatu** as well as all their correlatives also link to subjects using the _copula_.

**Myaw sen keloka?**  
Where is the cat?

**Filme sen kewatu?**  
When is the movie?

In informal language, the copula may be omitted when linking adjective phrases.

**Uma (sen) perfetomo syahe.**   
The horse is perfectly black. 

## Infinitive Verb Phrases <a id="nafalelexili_jumlemon"></a>

Infinitive verb phrases are marked by the particle **na** followed by the verb. They are used in the following sentence structures.

### Noun/Verb Complements

The infinitive verb form must be used in noun and verb (transitive, intransitive or _stative_) complements.

* Verb Complements

**Mi suki na lala.**  
I like to sing.

**Mi musi na ergo.**  
I must work. _or_ I have to work.

**Mi no abil na danse.**  
I cannot dance.

**Gitara sen asan na soti.**   
The guitar is easy to play.

**Mi sen jumbi na idi.**   
I am ready to go.

* Noun Complements

**misu xiwon na oko yu** - my desire to see you

### Nominal Verb Phrases

Verb phrases functioning in the place of noun phrases are known as _nominal verb phrases_ and require the infinitive verb form.

* With _copula_ (**sen**) sentences as shown above:

**Cele sen na triunfa.**  
The goal is to win.

In these sentences, subject infinitive verb phrases may be moved to the end of the sentence. However, the pronoun **to** must take the place of the infinitive verb phrase and a comma must be added before relocated phrase.

**Na sen nensabar sen problema.**   
To be impatient is a problem.    
_or_  
**To sen problem, na sen nensabar.**   
It is a problem to be impatient.

**Na soti gitara sen asan.**    
To play the guitar is easy. _or_ Playing the guitar is easy.    
_or_   
**To sen asan, na soti gitara.**    
It is easy to play the guitar.

**Na suyon in bahari sen amusane.**    
To swim in the sea is fun. _or_ Swimming in the sea is fun.    
_or_  
**To sen amusane, na suyon in bahari.**    
It is fun to swim in the sea.

* As the complement of a preposition:

**fe tayti fe na danse** - Instead of dancing

**Te le sokutu dur na danse.**    
He fell while dancing.

**Fe na doxo, nini le xorsomno.**    
Reading, the boy fell asleep.

## Prepositional Phrases <a id="plasilexili_jumlemon"></a>

Globasa, like most SVO languages, uses prepositions rather [postpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition). Prepositional phrases always immediately follow the noun phrases they modify.

**Myaw _in sanduku_ somno.**  
The cat _in the box_ is sleeping.  

Prepositional phrases that modify verbs enjoy relative free word order and may be moved anywhere in the sentence. When moved before the verb, commas are used as seen below. 

**Myaw yam _in sanduku_ maux.**    
**Myaw yam maux _in sanduku_.**   
**Myaw, _in sanduku_, yam maux.**   
**_In sanduku,_ myaw yam maux.**  
The cat eats the mouse _in the box_.

In order to indicate position without reference to location, prepositions are turned into nouns by adding **-ya** to form prepositional phrases with **fe**.

**Myaw sen _fe inya._**  
The cat is _inside_.

**Myaw _fe inya_ somno.**    
The cat _inside_ is sleeping.

**_Fe inya_, myaw somno.**    
_Inside_, the cat is sleeping.

### Indirect Object

The indirect object is always marked with the preposition **tas** (to, for). Indirect object phrases, like direct object phrases marked with **el**, may be moved without the need to indicate movement using commas.

**Mi gibe kitabu _tas nini_.**    
I give the book _to the child_.

**Mi gibe _tas nini_ kitabu.**    
I give _the child_ the book.

**Mi gibe kitabu _tas te_.**    
I give the book _to her/him_.

**Mi gibe _tas te_ kitabu.**    
I give _her/him_ the book.

**Mi gibe to _tas nini_.**    
I give it _to the child_.

**Mi gibe to _tas te_.**    
I give it _to her/him_.

**_Tas nini_ mi gibe kitabu.**    
_To the child_ I give a book.

**_Tas te_ mi gibe to.**    
_To her/him_ I give it.

### Phrasal Prepositions

Globasa uses a number of phrasal prepositions using **fe** followed by a noun followed by **de**. 

**Baytu _fe kapi de_ liljabal sen kimapul.**  
The houses _on top of_ the hill are expensive. 

In order to indicate position without reference to location, phrasal prepositions simply drop **de**.

**Baytu _fe kapi_ sen kimapul.**  
The houses _on top_ are expensive.

**_Fe kapi_, baytu sen kimapul.**   
_On top_, the houses are expensive.

**Kimapul baytu sen _fe kapi_.**  
The expensive houses are _on top_.

## Prepositional Verbs <a id="plasilexili_falelexi"></a>

In Globasa, prepositions may be turned into verbs using the suffix **-ya** as an alternative to linking prepositional phrases to subjects using the copula, as seen above. 

<table style="width:100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3"><b>Sentence Structure with Prepositional Verb </b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Prepositional Verb</th>
<th>Noun Phrase</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>myaw</b><br>cat</td>
<td><b>inya</b><br>is inside</td>
<td><b>sanduku</b><br>box</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" style="font-size:125%;"><b>Myaw inya sanduku.</b><br>The cat is inside the box.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Prepositional verbs may or may not be followed by a noun phrase.

**Myaw inya.**      
The cat is inside. 

Nouns used in phrasal prepositions may also be used as verbs in the same way as prepositional verbs.

**Myaw ruke sanduku.**      
The cat is behind the box.

**Myaw ruke.**      
The cat is in the back.

### leya and xaya

The nouns **leya** and **xaya** also function as the verb counterparts to the prepositions **lefe** and **xafe**. In other words, _lefeya_ and _xafeya_ are not used, just as **leli** and **xali** are used instead of _lefeli_ and _xafeli_.

* **leya** - (n) the past; (v) be before, come before, precede
* **xaya** - (n) the future; (v) be after, come after, follow

### feya

The prepositional verb **feya** (be at) may be optionally used as a _copula_ with **-loka** and **-watu** correlatives.

**Kastilo feya keloka?**  
Where is the castle located?

## hay

The verb **hay** is used to express _there is/are_. This is the only verb in Globasa that allows the subject to come either before or after the verb. Across languages, the subject of the equivalent of **hay** typically comes after the verb. 

**Multi kitabu hay in kitabudom.**   
_or_  
**Hay multi kitabu in kitabudom.**     
There are many books in the library.

The verb **hay** is also used in sentences related to atmospheric conditions, such as the following:

**Hay barix.** or **To barix.**   
"There is rain." or "It rains."   
It's raining.

**Hay termo.** or **To sen termopul.**    
"There is heat." or "It is warm."   
It's warm.

## Conjunction ki

The conjunction **ki** is used when a clause (_a sentence embedded into the main sentence_) functions in place of either the direct object or the subject.

### Clause in Place of Direct Object

<table style="width:100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="2"><b>Sentence Structure with Clause in Place of Direct Object</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Subject and Verb</th>
<th>Clause in Place of Direct Object</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>mi jixi</b><br>I know</td>
<td><b>ki yu le xuli mobil</b><br>(that) you repaired car</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" style="font-size:125%;"><b>Mi jixi ki yu le xuli mobil.</b><br>I know (that) you repaired the car. </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

### Clause in Place of Subject

<table style="width:100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="2"><b>Sentence Structure with Clause in Place of Subject</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Clause in Place of the Subject</th>
<th>Predicate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ki yu le xuli mobil </b><br>That you repaired the car </td>
<td><b>no surprisa mi</b><br>doesn't surprise me</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" style="font-size:125%;"><b>Ki yu le xuli mobil no surprisa mi.</b><br>That you repaired the car doesn't surprise me. </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Subject **ki** clauses may be moved to the end of the sentence. However, the pronoun **to** must take the place of the **ki** clause and a comma must be added before said phrase.

**To no surprisa mi, ki yu le xuli mobil.**    
It doesn't surprise me that you repaired the car.

## Questions 

In Globasa, the word order of interrogative sentences is the same as that of their counterpart declarative sentences. 

### Yes/No Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **kam** at the beginning of the question's countepart declarative sentence. This is illutrated in the following pairs of sentences with (1) a declarative sentence and (2) the counterpart yes/no question. 

(1) **Yu sen yamkal.**  
You are hungry.

(2) **Kam yu sen yamkal?**  
Are you hungry?

(1) **Yu yam mahimaso.**  
You eat fish.

(2) **Kam yu yam mahimaso?**  
Do you eat fish?

### Wh- Questions <a id="swal_yon_ke-"></a>

Likewise, wh- questions preserve typical word order. This is illustrated in the following pair of example sentences with (1) a question whose word order mirrors that of (2) a possible answer.  
(1) **Yusu name sen keto?**    
"Your name is what?"    
What is your name?

(2) **Misu name sen Robert.**    
My name is Robert.

(1) **Yu sen kepul?**    
"You are how?"    
How are you?

(2) **Mi sen bon.**    
I'm fine.

(1) **Parti xa okur keloka?**    
"The party will happen where?"    
Where will the party take place?

(2) **Parti xa okur in misu preferido restoran.**    
The party will take place in my favorite restaurant.

Colon questions in Globasa are as follows.

"You like what: coffee or tea?"  
Do you like coffee or tea?

**Yu ogar keloka: in Barati or Indonesi?**
