* **maux** -  mouse, mice
* **kalamu** - pen(s)

Globasa's nouns have neither definite nor indefinite articles.

* **janela** -  (a) window, (the) window(s)

If it is necessary to emphasize definiteness, **hin** (this/these) or **den** (that/those) may be used.

If it is necessary to emphasize singularity, **un** (one) may be used.

The more I read, the more I know.

The order of these phrases may switch places:

**Mi max jixi, folki mi max doxo.**  
I know more, the more I read.

### Verb Categories <a id="falelexili_klase"></a>

Verbs are defined in the dictionary as _auxiliary_, _copula_, _transitive_, _intransitive_, or _ambitransitive_.

#### Auxiliary Verbs

_Auxiliary verbs_ are immediately followed by another verb, which may be omitted. There are only three _auxiliary verbs_ in Globasa: **abil** (can, able to), **ingay** (should, ought to), **musi** (must, have to). 

#### Copula Verbs

_Copula verbs_ link the subject to its complement. There are currently 12 _copula verbs_: **sen** (be), **xorsen** (become), **sencu** (become), **sengi** (cause to be), **kwasisen** (seem), **okocu** (look), **orecu** (sound), **nasacu** (smell), **xetocu** (taste), **pifucu** (feel to touch), **hisicu** (feel physically), **ganjoncu** (feel emotionally). 

#### Transitive Verbs

_Transitive verbs_ take a direct object: **haja** (need), **bujo** (catch, capture), **gibe** (give). However, certain _transitive verbs_ will sometimes or often omit the direct object: **doxo** (read), **yam** (eat). 

#### Intransitive Verbs

_Intransitive verbs_ do not take a direct object: **idi** (go), **konduta** (behave), **loka** (be located). However, certain verbs labeled as intransitive may be used as _transitive verbs_ with the same noun/verb word repeated as the direct object, or likewise with a proper noun or category of said noun.

**Mi le somno (lungo somno).**  
I slept (a long sleep).

**Yu le haha (sotipul haha).**  
You laughed (a loud laugh). 

**Te xa lala (Hox Xencudin).**  
She will sing (Happy Birthday).

**Te danse (tango).**  
He's dancing (tango).

In theory, all other _intransitive verbs_ may be used transitively with an optional use of **[-gi](/gramati/inharelexi#xafefikso_-gi)**, although it may be a better practice to apply **-gi** in most cases.  

**Kam yu fley(gi) hawanavi?**  
Do you fly aircraft?

**Mi xa sampo(gi) bwaw fe axam.**  
I will walk the dog in the evening.

#### Ambitransitive Verbs 

[_Ambitransitive verbs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambitransitive_verb#Patientive) in Globasa are verbs for which both the subject of the intransitive meaning and the direct object of the transitive meaning experience the same action/state of the verb. The intransitive meaning of these verbs may optionally apply **[-cu](/gramati/inharelexi#xafefikso_-cu)** and the transitive meaning may optionally apply **[-gi](/gramati/inharelexi#xafefikso_-gi)**. See **-cu** and **-gi** below under _Common Affixes_. There are four subcategories of _ambitransitive verbs_: _verbs of feeling_, _verbs of state_, _agentless verbs_, and _verbs of position/location or movement_. 

_Verbs of Feeling_

_Ambitransitive verbs_ denoting a feeling mean _to feel [root noun] or cause to feel [root noun]_. Note that the intransitive meaning may also be expressed as a copula and adjective phrase: **sen** _[root noun]_**-do**. See **[-do](/gramati/inharelexi#xafefikso_-do)** below.

* **interes(cu)** - be/feel interested (_feel interest_)  
**interes(gi)** - interest (_cause to feel interest_)

**Mi interes(cu) tem basalogi.** = **Mi sen interesdo tem basalogi.**  
I'm interested in linguistics.

**Basalogi interes(gi) mi.**  
Linguistics interests me.
  
* **pilo(cu)** - be/feel tired (_feel fatigue_)   
**pilo(gi)** - tire (_cause to feel fatigue_)

**Te pilo(cu).** = **Te sen pilodo.**  
She is/feels tired.

**Tesu ergo pilo(gi) te.**  
Her work tires her.

The prefix **xor-** may be used with _verbs of feeling_ to express the following distinction:

**Mi le interes tem basalogi lefe multi nyan.**  
I was interested in linguistics many years ago.

**Te le pilo dur na ergo.**  
She was tired while working.

vesus:

**Mi le xorinteres tem basalogi lefe multi nyan.**  
I became interested in linguistics many years ago.

**Te le xorpilo dur na ergo.**  
She got/became tired while working.

_Verbs of State_

_Ambitransitive verbs of state_ are similar _verbs of feeling_. They are _nouns of state_ that can be used as _ambitransitive verbs_ meaning _to have [noun root] or to cause to have [noun root]_. Note that the intransitive meaning may also be expressed as a copula and adjective phrase: **sen** _[root noun]_**-pul**. See **[-pul](/gramati/inharelexi#xafefikso_-pul)** below. 

* **termo(cu)** - be hot/warm (_have heat_)  
**termo(gi)** - heat (_cause to have heat_)  

**Misu kafe no haji termo.** = **Misu kafe no haji sen termopul.**  
My coffee isn't hot any longer.

**Kam yu le termo banyo-kamer?**  
Did you warm up the bathroom?

* **cinon(cu)** - be intelligent (_have intelligence_)  
**cinon(gi)** - make intelligent (_cause to have intelligence_)  

**Syensiyen cinon.** = **Syensiyen sen cinonpul.**  
The scientist is intelligent. 

**Eskol le cinon te.**  
The school made him smart.  

* **talento(cu)** - be talented (_have talent_)  
**talento(gi)** - make talented (_cause to have talent_)  

**Lalayen talento.** = **Lalayen sen talentopul.**  
The singer is talented.

**Patre le talento lalayen.**  
The father made the singer talented.

The prefix **xor-** may be used with _verbs of state_ to express the following distinction:

**Jaledin le termo.** = **Jaledin le sen termopul.**  
Yesterday was warm

**To le xortermo fe midinuru.** = **To le xorsen/sencu termopul fe midinuru.**  
It got/became warm at noon. 

_Agentless Verbs_

In the intransitive meaning of _agentless ambitransitive verbs_, the action is something that happens to the subject rather than something the subject performs. 

* **kasiru(cu)** - break (_get broken_)  
**kasiru(gi)** - break (_cause to break_)  

**Janela le kasiru(cu).**  
The window broke. 

**Mi le kasiru(gi) janela.**  
I broke the window.

* **buka(cu)** - open (_become open_)  
**buka(gi)** - open (_make open_)

**Dwer le buka(cu).**   
The door opened.

**Mi le buka(gi) dwer.**   
I opened the door.

_Verbs of Position/Location or Movement_

In the intransitive meaning of _ambitransitive verbs of position/location or movement_ the subject is both agent and patient. 

* **esto(cu)** - stop (_come to a stop_)  
**esto(gi)** - stop (_bring to a stop or cause to stop_)

**Am esto(cu)!**  
Stop!

**Am esto(gi) mobil!**

**harka(gi)** - move (_cause to move_)

The following three verbs in this subcategory also use **xor-** as seen above to make a similar distinction in meaning:

* **side(cu)** - sit (_be seated/sitting_)  
**side(gi)** - seat (_cause to sit_)

**Te side(cu) fe fronta de darsu-kamer.**   
He's sitting at the front of the class.

* **xorleta(cu)** - lie down

**Am no xorleta per sofa!**  
Don't lie down on the couch!

## Adjective/Adverbs

In Globasa, adjectives and _verb-modifying adverbs_ have identical form.

* **bon** - good, well
* **velosi** - quick(ly), rapid(ly), fast
* **multi** - many, much

Adjective/adverbs precede the noun/verbs they modify.

**Hinto sen _bon yam_.**  
This is a _good meal_.

**Bebe _bon yam_.**  
The baby _eats well_.

**Uma _velosi pawbu_.**  
The horse _runs fast_.

Alternatively, adverbs may appear after the verb, but preceded by the direct and indirect objects, if any: Subject - Verb - (Direct and Indirect Objects) - Adverb.

**Bebe yam _bon_.**  
The baby eats _well_.

**Bwaw glu sui _velosi_.**  
The dog drinks the water _quickly_.

Adverbs may also be moved to the start of the sentence, so long as there is a definite pause with the comma so as to separate the phrase from the rest of the sentence. Without the pause, the adjective/adverb could be mistakenly interpreted as modifying the subject.  

**_Velosi_, bwaw glu sui.**  
_Quickly_, the dog drinks the water.

**_Unyum_, te le idi cel banko.**  
_First_, she went to the bank.

### Adjective/Adverbs in Sentence-Initial Phrases

The following are adjective/adverbs commonly used in sentence-initial phrases followed by a clear pause before the rest of the sentence.

* **Ripul,** - Again  
* **Ible,** - Maybe, Perhaps  
* **Maxpul,** - Moreover, Furthermore  
* **Pia,** - Also  
* **Abruto,** - Suddenly

* **Nerleli,** - Recently  
* **Telileli,** - A long time ago  
* **Nerxali,** - Soon  
* **Telixali,** - In a long time  

### Adjective/Adverb Comparison

Adjective/adverb comparison is expressed as follows using the words **maxmo** (_more, -er_), **minmo** (_less_), **denmo** (_as_),**kom** (_as, than_).

* **maxmo kimapul kom...** - more expensive than...
* **minmo kimapul kom...** - less expensive than...
* **denmo kimapul kom...** - as expensive as...

To express _the most (-est)_ and _the least_, Glosaba uses **maxim... te/to** and **minim... te/to**. The word **of** means _out of_ or _off (of)_. Note that the pronouns **te**/**to** must immediately follow the adjective since noun phrases must always end in a noun or pronoun. See [Noun Phrases](/gramati/jumlemonli-estrutur#pronamelexi_in_namelexili_jumlemon).

* **maxim juni te (of misu bete)** - the youngest (of my children)
* **minim kimapul to (of yusu mobil)** - the least expensive/costly (of your cars)

To express _the more/the less..., the more/the less..._, Globasa uses **folki maxmo/minmo, maxmo/minmo**.

* **folki (to sen) maxmo neo, (to sen) maxmo bon** - the newer, the better

## Verb/Adj-Adv Words

Besides noun/verb words and adj/adv words, Globasa has a third class of words: _verb/adj-adv words_. Only auxiliary verbs belong in this class which consists of only three words: **abil**, **musi** and **ingay**.  

* **abil**: (verb) can, able to; (adj/adv) able, capable, which can  
* **musi**: (verb) must, have to; (adj/adv) which must, which has to  
* **ingay**: (verb) should, ought to; (adj/adv) which should, which ought to

_Etymology of **pul**: English (full), Hindi (पूर्ण  “purn”), Russian (полный “poln-”)_

### Active Adjectives: Suffix -ne <a id="xafefikso_-ne"></a>

The suffix **-ne** means _in an active state or process of_ and is used to derive what are known in Globasa as _active adjectives_.

_Active adjectives_ are in most cases equivalent to _present participles_ in English (adjectives ending in _-ing_). However, unlike in English, _active adjectives_ are not used to generate the _progressive verb_ forms (_I am sleeping_, _She is dancing_, etc.). Instead, they only function as adjectives.

* **somno** - sleep  
**_somnone_ meliyen** - _sleeping_ beauty

* **anda** - walk  
**_andane_ moryen** - _walking_ dead

* **danse** - dance

_Etymology of **-ne**: English (-ing), French (-ant), Spanish (-ando), German (-en, -ende), Russian (-ный “-ny”), Turkish (-en, -an)_

### Sentence-Initial Active Adjectives

Active adjectives that appear sentence initially may alternatively be expressed as prepositional phrases using the infinitive verb form.

**_Doxone,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_Reading,_ the kid fell asleep.

_or_

**_Fe na doxo,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_Reading,_ the kid fell asleep.  
_or_  
**_Dur na doxo,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_While reading,_ the kid fell asleep. 

This construction is useful particularly when the phrase includes a direct object since, unlike the _present participle_ in English, _active adjectives_ in Globasa cannot function as verbs.

**_Dur na doxo sesu preferido kitabu,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_While reading his favorite book,_ the kid fell asleep.

Naturally, these phrases may also be expressed as full clauses, as opposed to prepositional phrases.

**_Durki te le doxo (sesu preferido kitabu),_ nini le xorsomno.**

The suffix **-do** means _in an inactive state of_. Words with this suffix are known in Globasa as _inactive adjectives_ and are typically translated as the _past participle_ in English. However, unlike in English, _inactive adjectives_ are not used to generate _perfect_ or _passive verb_ forms (_I have worked_, _It was/got stolen_, etc.). Instead, they function only as adjectives.
