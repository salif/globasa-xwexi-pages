## Notes

### _ke_ vs _kete/keto_

The word **ke**, like **hin** and **den**, must always be followed by either a noun or pronoun.

* **ke medisyen?**    
which physician?     
**kete?**  
who? _or_ which one?  

* **ke kitabu?**    
what book? _or_ which book?   
**keto?**  
what? _or_ which one?  

### _hinete/hinoto, denete/denoto, keete/keoto_

The words **ete** and **oto**, the plural counterparts of **te** and **to**, may also be attached to **hin**, **den** and **ke** in order to form the words **hinete**/**hinoto** (these; these ones), **denete**/**denoto** (those; those ones), **keete** (who; which people; which ones), **keoto** (what; what things; which ones). However, since **te** and **to** may be used with words denoting plurality, **-te/-to** may also be used when number is unknown, such as when asking _who_ and _what_. For this reason, **keete** and **keoto** are rarely used. 

### Questions with _ke_

Questions with **ke** have the same word order as their counterpart declarative sentences.

**Medisyen yam keto?**  
“The doctor eats what?”  
What does the doctor eat?

**Yu xa doxo ke kitabu?**       
"You will read which/what book?"  
What/which book will you read?  

### _cel_

The word **cel** is used only for denoting _movement _, _destination_, _target_ or _purpose_, never as the _recipient_ (commonly known as the _indirect object_) marker. In a subsequent lesson, you will learn the word that marks the _recipient_.  

The phrase **cel na** means _in order to_. Much like in English, since **na** (seen in Lesson 4) marks verb phrases, it may be used alone to introduce purpose.

**Polisiyen le idi cel kitabudom (cel) na doxo kitabu.**  
The police officer went to the library (in order) to read a book. 

The word **cel** may be paired with other prepositions: **cel in** (_into_) and **cel ex** (_out from, out of_). 

**Polisiyen le pawbu cel in kitabudom.**  
The police officer ran into the library.

### Compound Words with _yen_

The word **yen** typically refers to people, although it may technically denote _any life form_. It is often used to create compounds with nouns, verbs and adjectives.

With noun/verb words:

* **alim** (teach) - **alimyen** (teacher)
* **polisi** (police) - **polisiyen** (police officer)

With adj/adv words:

* **juni** (young) - **juniyen** (a young being/person, a youth)
* **bala** (strong) - **balayen** (a strong being/person)

The words _man_ and _woman_ can also be expressed as **manyen** and **femyen**. Technically, **manyen** refers to any male (whether _boy_ or _man_) and **femyen** refers to any female (whether _girl_ or _woman_). However, since we would typically use **nini** for an underage human, **manyen** and **femyen** may be used not only when we're unsure of the person's age, but when we're referring specifically to an adult or a teenager (a young man/lady). By extension, **yen** may be used by itself to mean _gal_ or _guy_. 

## Example Sentences

**Den femyen sen medisyen.**  
That lady is a doctor.

**Alimyen idi cel eskol.**  
The teacher goes to the school.

**Polisiyen hare keto?**  
What does the police officer have?

## Reading and Listening Practice

Multi ixu idi cel day eskol. Multi te ata cel na xwexi na bon koki. Eskol hare juni alimyen.

Xwexiyen loga, "Imi xa koki keto?"

Alimyen loga, "Uyu xa koki neo yam."

Xwexiyen loga, "Ke yam? Yam hare keto?"

Alimyen loga, "Patato, bwaw ji uma."

Gao xwexiyen sen polisiyen. Te no sen hox: "Keto?! Dento no sen yam! Bwaw ji uma sen meli! Ete sen doste!"

Alimyen loga, "Fe lutuf, multi te suki na yam xosu bwaw ji uma. Kam yu aham?" 

Polisiyen loga, "No! Ete no sen yam! Yu xa idi cel polisidom."
