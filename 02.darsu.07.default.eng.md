## Notes

### _ke_ vs _kete/keto_

The word **ke**, like **hin** and **den**, must always be followed by either a noun or pronoun.

* **ke medisyen?**    
which physician?     
**kete?**  
who? _or_ which one?  

* **ke kitabu?**    
what book? _or_ which book?   
**keto?**  
what? _or_ which one?  

### _hinete/hinoto, denete/denoto, keete/keoto_

The words **ete** and **oto**, the plural counterparts of **te** and **to**, may also be attached to **hin**, **den** and **ke** in order to form the words **hinete**/**hinoto** (these; these ones), **denete**/**denoto** (those; those ones), **keete** (who; which people; which ones), **keoto** (what; what things; which ones). However, since **te** and **to** may be used with words denoting plurality, **-te/-to** may also be used when number is unknown, such as when asking _who_ and _what_. For this reason, **keete** and **keoto** are rarely used. 

### Questions with _ke_

Questions with **ke** have the same word order as their counterpart declarative sentences.

**Medisyen yam keto?**  
“The doctor eats what?”  
What does the doctor eat?

**Yu xa doxo ke kitabu?**       
"You will read which/what book?"  
What/which book will you read?  

### _cel_

The word **cel** is used only for denoting _movement _, _destination_, _target_ or _purpose_, never as the _recipient_ (commonly known as the _indirect object_) marker. In a subsequent lesson, you will learn the word that marks the _recipient_.  

The phrase **cel na** means _in order to_. Much like in English, since **na** (seen in Lesson 4) marks verb phrases, it may be used alone to introduce purpose.

**Polisiyen le idi cel kitabudom (cel) na doxo kitabu.**  
The police officer went to the library (in order) to read a book. 

The word **cel** may be paired with other prepositions: **cel in** (_into_) and **cel ex** (_out from, out of_). 

**Polisiyen le pawbu cel in kitabudom.**  
The police officer ran into the library.

### Compound Words with _yen_

The word **yen** typically refers to people, although it may technically denote _any life form_. It is often used to create compounds with nouns, verbs and adjectives.

With noun/verb words:

* **alim** (teach) - **alimyen** (teacher)
* **polisi** (police) - **polisiyen** (police officer)

With adj/adv words:

* **juni** (young) - **juniyen** (a young being/person, a youth)
* **bala** (strong) - **balayen** (a strong being/person)

The words _man_ and _woman_ can also be expressed as **manyen** and **femyen**. Technically, **manyen** refers to any male (whether _boy_ or _man_) and **femyen** refers to any female (whether _girl_ or _woman_). However, since we would typically use **nini** for an underage human, **manyen** and **femyen** may be used not only when we're unsure of the person's age, but when we're referring specifically to an adult or a teenager (a young man/lady). By extension, **yen** may be used by itself to mean _gal_ or _guy_.
