## Notes
### _nun_

The verb particle **nun** is used to express the present moment. It is typically omitted unless one wishes to emphasize that the activity is currently taking place. 

### Past, Present and Future

The verb tense particles (**nun, le, xa**) may be turned into abstract nouns by adding **-ya**, which may be used in prepositional phrases with **fe**. Note that **fe** is obligatory in these phrases. 

* **fe nunya** - in the present, now
* **fe leya** - in the past, previously
* **fe xaya** - in the future, later 

### Now and Then

Although **fe nunya** is the most common way to express _now_, **hinwatu** is also used. The expression **hinwatu**, however, contrasts with **denwatu** (_then, at that time_). 

### Compound Words with _nun_, _le_ and _xa_

The verb particles **nun**, **le** and **xa** are used as quasi-prefixes in a specific and limited number of words, primarily those that appear in this lesson's word list.

### The prefix _ja-_

The prefix **ja-** means _immediately adjacent_. As you can see in this lesson, **ja-** is used in the words **jaledin** (_yesterday_) and **jaxadin** (_tomorrow_). 

### _lefe_ and _xafe_

The prepositions **lefe** (_before_) and **xafe** (_after_) are composed of the verb tense prefixes **le** and **xa** plus the multi-purpose preposition **fe**. They can also be used to express _ago_ and _in_ (_after some time_). 

**Misu gami le irsal tas yu netoposta lefe tiga din.**  
My spouse sent you an email three days ago.

**Yu abil na xwexi Globasa xafe un nyan.**  
You can learn Globasa in one year.

### Days of the Week

The days of the week are expressed as derived words using the international astronomical method by attaching **din** (_day_) as a quasi-suffix. 

Monday - **Lunadin** (**Luna** - Earth's moon)  
Tuesday - **Marihidin** (**Marihi** - Mars)  
Wednesday - **Bududin** (**Budu** - Mercury)  
Thursday - **Muxtaridin** (**Muxtari** - Jupiter)  
Friday - **Zuhuradin** (**Zuhura** - Venus)  
Saturday - **Xanidin** (**Xani** - Saturn)  
Sunday - **Soladin** (**Sola** - Earth's sun)  

To express a phrase like _on Mondays_, the word **duli**, seen in Lesson 18, is used: (**fe**) **duli Lunadin**, (**fe**) **duli Marihidin**, etc. 

### Noun-Noun Compounds

As we have seen with words such as **dom**, **kamer**, **dukan** and **din**, _noun-noun_ compounds can be freely formed in Globasa using any noun.
