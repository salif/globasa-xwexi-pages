The order of these phrases may switch places:

### Verb Categories <a id="falelexili_klase"></a>

Verbs are defined in the dictionary as _auxiliary_, _copula_, _transitive_,  _intransitive_, _agentive ambitransitive_ or _patientive ambitransitive_.

#### Auxiliary Verbs

Auxiliary verbs are immediately followed by another verb, which may be omitted. There are only three auxiliary verbs in Globasa: **abil** (can, able to), **ingay** (should, ought to), **musi** (must, have to). 

#### Copula Verbs

Copula verbs link the subject to its complement. There are only a handful of copula verbs: **sen** (be), **sencu** (become), **sengi** (cause to be), **kwasisen** (seem). 

#### Transitive Verbs

Transitive verbs take a direct object and rarely omit it: **haja** (need), **bujo** (catch, capture), **gibe** (give). 

#### Intransitive Verbs

Intransitive Verbs never take a direct object: **idi** (go), **konduta** (behave), **loka** (be located). 

#### Agentive Ambitransitive Verbs

#### Patientive Ambitransitive Verbs 

[Patientive ambitransitive verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambitransitive_verb#Patientive) are verbs for which both the subject of the intransitive reading and the direct object of the transitive reading experience the same action/state of the verb. The intransitive reading of these verbs may optionally take **-cu** and the transitive reading may optionally take **-gi**.

**esto(gi)** - stop (_bring to a stop or cause to stop_)

**Am esto(cu)!**  
Stop!

**Am esto(gi) mobil!**

## Adjective/Adverbs

In Globasa, adjectives and _verb-modifying adverbs_ have identical form.

* **bon** - good, well
* **velosi** - quick(ly), rapid(ly), fast
* **multi** - many, much

Adjective/adverbs precede the noun/verbs they modify.

**Hinto sen _bon yam_.**  
This is a _good meal_.

**Bebe _bon yam_.**  
The baby _eats well_.

**Uma _velosi pawbu_.**  
The horse _runs fast_.

Alternatively, adverbs may appear after the verb, but preceded by the direct and indirect objects, if any: Subject - Verb - (Direct and Indirect Objects) - Adverb.

**Bebe yam _bon_.**  
The baby eats _well_.

**Bwaw glu sui _velosi_.**  
The dog drinks the water _quickly_.

Adverbs may also be moved to the start of the sentence, so long as there is a definite pause with the comma so as to separate the phrase from the rest of the sentence. Without the pause, the adjective/adverb could be mistakenly interpreted as modifying the subject.  

**_Velosi_, bwaw glu sui.**  
_Quickly_, the dog drinks the water.

**_Unyum_, te le idi cel banko.**  
_First_, she went to the bank.

### Adjective/Adverbs in Sentence-Initial Phrases

The following are adjective/adverbs commonly used in sentence-initial phrases followed by a clear pause before the rest of the sentence.

* **Ripul,** - Again  
* **Ible,** - Maybe, Perhaps  
* **Maxpul,** - Moreover, Furthermore  
* **Pia,** - Also  
* **Abruto,** - Suddenly

### Adjective/Adverb Comparison

Adjective/adverb comparison is expressed as follows using the words **maxmo** (_more, -er_), **minmo** (_less_), **denmo** (_as_),**kom** (_as, than_).

* **maxmo kimapul kom...** - more expensive than...
* **minmo kimapul kom...** - less expensive than...
* **denmo kimapul kom...** - as expensive as...

To express _the most (-est)_ and _the least_, Glosaba uses **maxim... te/to** and **minim... te/to**. The word **of** means _out of_ or _off (of)_. Note that the pronouns **te**/**to** must immediately follow the adjective since noun phrases must always end in a noun or pronoun. See [Noun Phrases](/gramati/jumlemonli-estrutur#pronamelexi_in_namelexili_jumlemon).

* **maxim juni te (of misu bete)** - the youngest (of my children)
* **minim kimapul to (of yusu mobil)** - the least expensive/costly (of your cars)

To express _the more/the less..., the more/the less..._, Globasa uses **folki maxmo/minmo, maxmo/minmo**.

* **folki (to sen) maxmo neo, (to sen) maxmo bon** - the newer, the better

## Verb/Adj-Adv Words

Besides noun/verb words and adj/adv words, Globasa has a third class of words: _verb/adj-adv words_. Only auxiliary verbs belong in this class which consists of only three words: **abil**, **musi** and **ingay**.

### Adjective/Adverb Suffix -li <a id="xafefikso_-li"></a>

* **jawgu** - care, take care  
**jawgupul** - careful

* **hatari** - danger  
**hataripul** - dangerous

_Etymology of **pul**: English (full), Hindi (पूर्ण  “purn”), Russian (полный “poln-”)_

### Active Adjectives: Suffix -ne <a id="xafefikso_-ne"></a>

The suffix **-ne** means _in an active state or process of_ and is used to derive what are known in Globasa as _active adjectives_.

_Active adjectives_ are in most cases equivalent to _present participles_ in English (adjectives ending in _-ing_). However, unlike in English, _active adjectives_ are not used to generate the _progressive verb_ forms (_I am sleeping_, _She is dancing_, etc.). Instead, they only function as adjectives.

* **somno** - sleep  
**_somnone_ meliyen** - _sleeping_ beauty

* **anda** - walk  
**_andane_ moryen** - _walking_ dead

* **danse** - dance  
**_dansene_ uma** - _dancing_ horse

**_interesne_ kitabu** - _interesting_ book

**_amusane_ filme** - _amusing/fun_ film

_Etymology of **-ne**: English (-ing), French (-ant), Spanish (-ando), German (-en, -ende), Russian (-ный “-ny”), Turkish (-en, -an)_

### Sentence-Initial Active Adjectives

Active adjectives that appear sentence initially may alternatively be expressed as prepositional phrases using the infinitive verb form.

**_Doxone,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_Reading,_ the kid fell asleep.

_or_

**_Fe na doxo,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_Reading,_ the kid fell asleep.  
_or_  
**_Dur na doxo,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_While reading,_ the kid fell asleep. 

This construction is useful particularly when the phrase includes a direct object since, unlike the _present participle_ in English, _active adjectives_ in Globasa cannot function as verbs.

**_Dur na doxo sesu preferido kitabu,_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_While reading his favorite book,_ the kid fell asleep.

Naturally, these phrases may also be expressed as full clauses, as opposed to prepositional phrases.

**_Dur te le doxo (sesu preferido kitabu),_ nini le xorsomno.**  
_While he read (his favorite book),_ the kid fell asleep.

### Passive Adjectives

_Active adjectives_ may be rendered passive by adding the passive prefix **be-** to derive what are known in Globasa as _passive active adjectives_ (or _passive adjectives_ for short). There is no exact equivalent in English for _passive adjectives_, but are best understood as the exact passive form of the _present participle_ in English.

* **belalane melodi** - melody that is sung or being sung  
* **belubine doste** - beloved friend or friend that is loved

### Inactive Adjectives: Suffix -do <a id="xafefikso_-do"></a>

The suffix **-do** means _in an inactive state of_. Words with this suffix are known in Globasa as _inactive adjectives_ and are typically translated as the _past participle_ in English. However, unlike in English, _inactive adjectives_ are not used to generate _perfect_ or _passive verb_ forms (_I have worked_, _It was/got stolen_, etc.). Instead, they function only as adjectives.

It is worth noting that, technically speaking, the suffix **-do** is added to the _noun_ aspect of noun/verbs. For this reason, **-do** may be added to transitive, intransitive or ambitransitive verbs noun/verbs.

#### With transitive verbs

* **hajado ergo** - necessary work (_in a state of necessity_)   
* **bujodo morgiyen** - captured murderer (_in a state of capture_)

#### With intransitive verbs

* **Uncudo Nasyonlari** - United Nations (_in a state of union_)  
* **awcudo fleytora** - disappeared airplane (_in a state of disappearance_)  

#### With ambitransitive verbs

* **kasirudo janela** - broken window (_in a state of breakage_)  
* **klosido dwer** - closed door (_in a state of closure_)  

_Etymology of **-do**: English (-ed), Spanish (-ado, -ido)_

### Adverb Suffix -mo <a id="xafefikso_-mo"></a>

Adjective/adverbs that modify other adjective/adverbs, known as _adj/adv-modifying adverbs_, add the suffix **-mo**. Compare the following pairs of phrases.

* **perfeto blue oko** - perfect blue eyes (_blue eyes that are perfect_)  
**perfetomo blue oko** - perfectly blue eyes (_eyes that are perfectly blue_)
