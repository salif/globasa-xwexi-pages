## Notes
### kepul

The question word **kepul** asks the listener/reader to describe the object or action. Like all question words, it is used in the same spot where the answer to the question would be. 

Example 1:

**Bwaw sen _kepul_?**  
How is the dog? _or_ What is the dog like? 

Although the question above is ambiguous, the context of the conversation will typically make the question clear. 

**Bwaw sen _hox_.**  
The dog is happy. 

Example 2:

**Yu hare _kepul_ ergo?**  
What is the job that you have like? or What kind of job do you have?

Notice how convoluted the question in English is. In Globasa, the question is straight-forward because it works the same way as the statement. Notice how the answer (**asan**) below will fit in the exact same spot as **kepul**.

**Mi hare _asan_ ergo.**  
I have an easy job. 

Example 3:

**_Kepul_ uma abil na pawbu velosi?**  
What kind of horse can run fast?

**_Bala_ uma abil na pawbu velosi.**  
A strong horse can run fast.

### Superlative Adjectives

Superlative adjectives are expressed using **maxim** (_most, -est_) and **minim** (_least_). Superlative adjectives occurring within noun phrases must add **(e)te** or **(o)to** if the noun is not expressed in the phrase. Prepositional phrases with **of** (_out of, from_) or **in** may be used for more complete sentences. 

**Misu maxim juni sodar sen minim gao te of famil.**    
My youngest sibling is the least tall (one) of the family. 

**Maxim pesapul ete sen maxim lao ete.**  
The richest (ones) are the oldest (ones). 

## Example Sentences

**Maria sen maxim juni te of misu bete.**  
Maria is the youngest of my children.

**Piu sen kepul?**  
What is the bird like? _or_ How is the bird?

**Manixu vole kepul pantalun?**  
What kind of pants does the man want?
